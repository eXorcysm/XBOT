# XBOT AI

Named after one of the Three Robots from the *Love, Death & Robots* series, XBOT is a large language model (LLM) chatbot built with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enabled. As interaction progresses, XBOT periodically saves chat history and rebuilds her vector database upon restart. As such, her knowledge and awareness of the user will continue to grow with engagement.

**NOTE:** This application is designed for LOCAL deployment only! Future versions will be adapted for cloud hosting.

## Deployment on Hugging Face Space (not recommended)

1. Create a new Hugging Face Space via the Docker template to run the Ollama server. Upload ollama.sh and Dockerfile, and the space will build automatically.

2. Create a second Hugging Face Space to run XBOT via the Gradio template and connecting to this repo.

### Features

- XBOT is designed to role-play as a loyal companion and helpful assistant.
- The LLM is a quantized version of [Fimbulvetr](https://huggingface.co/backyardai/Fimbulvetr-11B-v2-GGUF) -- a model fine-tuned for RP and storytelling.
- The embedding model is a fine-tuned version of [bge-small-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/hoangthethief/best_model).
- XBOT can provide both streaming (default) and batch responses.
- The RAG pipeline incorporates a [reranker](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-base).

### Future Improvements

- Enable the user to dynamically perform the following via the UI:
    - change models
    - load custom character cards
    - edit/delete messages
    - upload avatars
- Add multimodal capabilities for image and sound processing.
- Add evaluation system.
- Add guardrails.
- Add agentic functions.
